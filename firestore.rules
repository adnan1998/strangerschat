/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset is designed to be permissive for authenticated 
 * users to facilitate rapid development and testing, while protecting against 
 * unauthenticated access and preventing users from modifying each other's private data.
 *
 * It prioritizes a smooth development experience by removing complex read restrictions
 * that were causing persistent "permission-denied" errors in client-side listeners.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Open Read Access for Authenticated Users: To prevent listener errors, any
 *   signed-in user can read data from any collection. This simplifies development.
 * - Ownership-Based Writes: Users can only write to their own documents in the
 *   `/users` and `/online_users` collections. This is the core security boundary.
 * - Open Chat Writes: Any authenticated user can create chat rooms and messages.
 *   This is suitable for a low-stakes, anonymous chat application.
